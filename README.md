# UVT Beamer Theme

This is a reproduction of the UVT (West University of Timi»ôoara) Power Point
template in LaTeX. It uses the UVT [branding](https://dci.uvt.ro/identitate-vizuala)
and is based on the example given in the
[Official Manual](https://www.dci.uvt.ro/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MANUAL-IDENTITATE-NEW-WEB-FINAL-2016-.pdf).
As the example in the official branding manual is not very friendly to scientific
presentations, this theme will probably take some liberties with it.

This template style is fairly complete and working well, but any feature requests
or bug reports to improve it are **very welcome**!

## How to use it

Copy the `beamerthemeuvt.sty` and the accompanying `sty` files to your local
directory together with any relevant assets from the `assets` folder. You can also
use the `template.tex` to get you started with a few useful options and examples.
Modify `template.tex` as appropriate and build with `pdflatex` (or `xelatex` or
`lualatex` for the adventurous).

The package defines the following options used as `\usetheme[opts]{uvt}`.

| Option                            | Description                           |
| :-                                | :-                                    |
| `nomyriadpro`                     | Do not load the *Myriad Pro* fonts    |
| `language=<lang>`                 | One of *english* or *romanian*        |
| `progressbar`                     | Adds a yellow progress bar in the footer |
| `layoutgrid`                      | Adds a debug grid to check alignment  |

## Fonts

Note that, by default this uses the [Myriad Pro](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/myriad)
font. This font is generally not available for free, but can be purchased from
Adobe or a [reseller](https://www.fontspring.com/fonts/adobe/myriad-pro). The
OTF fonts can be directly loaded by the `XeLaTeX` or `LuaLaTeX` engines. To
get it working on `PDFLaTeX`, use the [FontPro](https://github.com/sebschub/FontPro)
distribution. If you cannot obtain the font (or the installation does not work
for some reason), it can be disabled with the `nomyriadpro` option. In general,
we recommend using a free sans serif font instead, e.g `\usepackage{helvet}` for
the Helvetica look-alike Nimbus Sans L or `\usepackage{paratype}` for the PT Sans
fonts that resemble Myriad Pro better.

If you are using `XeLaTeX` or `LuaLaTeX`, there are many other nice fonts to
keep in mind that would work well. For example: Carlito (a Calibri clone),
Caladea (a Cambria clone), Montserrat (inspired by Gotham), Adobe Source Sans,
etc. A nice font will always make your presentation look nicer!
