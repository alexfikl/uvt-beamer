This is a reproduction of the UVT (West University of Timi»ôoara) Power Point
template in LaTeX. It uses the official [UVT branding](https://dci.uvt.ro/identitate-vizuala)
and is based on the example given in the
[Official Manual](https://www.dci.uvt.ro/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MANUAL-IDENTITATE-NEW-WEB-FINAL-2016-.pdf).
As the example in the official branding manual is not very friendly to scientific
presentations, this theme will probably take some liberties with it.

## How to Use It

Copy the `beamerthemeuvt.sty` and the accompanying `beamercolorthemeuvt.sty` file
to your local directory together with any relevant assets from the `assets` folder. You can
use the `template.tex` file to get you started with a few useful options and examples.
The `template.tex` can then be built with `PDFLaTeX` (or `XeLaTeX` or `LuaLaTeX`
for the adventurous).

The package defines the following options used as `\usetheme[opts]{uvt}`.

| Option                            | Description                           |
| :-                                | :-                                    |
| `nomyriadpro`                     | Do not load the *Myriad Pro* fonts    |
| `language=<lang>`                 | One of *english* or *romanian*        |
| `progressbar`                     | Adds a yellow progress bar in the footer |
| `showframe`                       | Shows a frame around page elements (margins, etc.) |
| `layoutgrid`                      | Adds a debug grid to check alignment  |

The `language` is used to automatically select the logos with appropriate text.
This can be avoided by providing your own logos using the following commands,
but care must be taken to size them nicely.

| Macro                             | Description                           |
| :-                                | :-                                    |
| `\uvtheaderlogo`                  | Logo used in the header of each frame |
| `\uvtmotto`                       | Colorful motto used in the footer of each slide |
| `\uvttitlelogo`                   | Large logo used on the titlepage      |
| `\uvtslidelogo`                   | Transparent logo used as background on slides |
| `\venue`                          | Venue name (for the presentation) in title page |

## Fonts

Note that, by default this uses the [Myriad Pro](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/myriad)
font. This font is generally not available for free, but can be purchased from
Adobe or a [reseller](https://www.fontspring.com/fonts/adobe/myriad-pro). The
OTF fonts can be directly loaded by the `XeLaTeX` or `LuaLaTeX` engines. To
get it working on `PDFLaTeX`, use the [FontPro](https://github.com/sebschub/FontPro)
distribution. If you cannot obtain the font (or the installation does not work
for some reason), it can be disabled with the `nomyriadpro` option. When the font
is not found, the class falls back to using `\usepackage{helvet}`, which loads a
Helvetica look-alike called Nimbus Sans L.

If you are using `XeLaTeX` or `LuaLaTeX`, there are many other nice fonts to
keep in mind that would work well. For example: Carlito (a Calibri clone),
Caladea (a Cambria clone), Montserrat (inspired by Gotham), Adobe Source Sans,
etc. A nice font will always make your presentation look nicer!
